# Minesweeper
game of minesweeper
This program runs the classic game of minesweeper.  It first asks for the dimensions of the game then a number of bombs to be hidden in
the field.  The game is then created and the user can either claim a space as a bomb or free space.  If all free spaces or all bombs are
found, or if a bomb is hit the game is over
